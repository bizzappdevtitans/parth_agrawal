<h2 id="configuration"><strong>Configuration</strong></h2>
<p>
  <strong
    >To set up the Connector Clickup module, you need to provide the following
    information:</strong
  >
</p>
<p><strong>Production Mode(API Key Authentication)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    API Key: An API token obtained from ClickUp to authenticate your application's
    access to ClickUp's API.
  </li>
  <li>
    Location/URI: The unique identifier known as the space id is required from where you
    want to import or export projects and tasks.
  </li>
  <li>Version: Provide the version on which the api will working on.</li>
  <li>Url Path: The base url which can be change according to the requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Test Mode(API Key Authentication)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Test Token: Same as production mode here we also need to provide the token in Test
    Token field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Test Location: We need to provide the space id in test location field if the test
    mode is enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    Test Version: Take the same value as we store in Version field in production mode.
  </li>
  <li>Test Url Path: Store the base url as we store in Url Path in production mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oauth 2.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    To use Oauth 2.0 in clickup backend user can select authentication type as OAuth
    authentication in Test or Production mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    User needs to Enter credentials like client_id, client_secret and redirect url.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then after user needs to click on the button called Generate Oauth Code that will
    redirect user to authentication page.
  </li>
  <li>
    After successfully authentication the user will be redirect to new url, User needs
    to copy that Url and paste it in Auth Code field that is avaiable at clickup backend
    level.
  </li>
  <li>Now User need to fill the remaining information like Location/URI, Version.</li>
  <li>
    After that just click on Generate Token button which will set the new access_token
    in API Key field at clickup backend level.
  </li>
  <li>
    Note: All the credential fields for API key authentication and OAuth 2.0
    authentication are available for Production mode as well as Test mode.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    To correctly import or export the project and tasks we should select one
    workspace(team) at the time of generation authentication code if authentication type
    is Oauth authentication or provide one workspace id(team) if auth type is API key.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can import projects and tasks from more than one space(URI/Test location). At the
    time of export if folder id is no provided it will be exported to first space id.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating different backend for workspaces(team) and location(space id) is
    recommended.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features-highlights"><strong>Features &amp; Highlights</strong></h2>
<p>
  <strong>The Connector Clickup module offers the following functionalities:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Import Projects and Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Import projects and their corresponding tasks from ClickUp into your application.
  </li>
  <li>Use the provided API token and Space ID to specify the source in ClickUp.</li>
  <li>
    Retrieve project data such as project name, description, start and end dates and
    other relevant information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Retrieve task data such as task name, description, deadline, tags and other relevant
    information.
  </li>
  <li>Map imported projects to the corresponding entities in your application.</li>
  <li>
    If the last task update time is same as the time stored in project.task level then
    it will save extra processing time in queue job to import that task.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Export Projects and Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Export projects and their tasks from your application to ClickUp's remote website.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can set space ID in project level to specify the destination in ClickUp else it
    will be exported in default backend's space id.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer project data, including project name, description, task details, and any
    associated metadata.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure synchronization between your application and ClickUp by exporting changes
    made in your application.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Batch Processing:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Through One click we can get all projects available to that space and same applies
    to stages and tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Perform bulk imports or exports by utilizing queue jobs with user friendly
    description.
  </li>
  <li>Use related button in queue job to redirect to project, stage or task record.</li>
  <li>
    Queue jobs enable you to process multiple projects or tasks simultaneously,
    improving efficiency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Track the status of queued operations and handle any errors or mapping issues.

<h2 id="current-behaviourfuture-scope">
  <strong>Current Behaviour/Future Scope</strong>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Currently only That stages can be imported that is implemented for folder level or
    whole space level in clickup website.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently we set the team id in backend automatically in Oauth 2.0 authentication
    that helps to open particular project at clickup website, If team ids are more then
    one it will be stored as comma seperated values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently if we dont choose folder to export particular project,by default it will
    be exported in to the space.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently We need to first create stage in clickup website, import that stage in
    order to use that stage in tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently If the Stage already exist in project.task.type model the queue job will
    raise mapping error for that particular record.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently If the stages are not imported before importing the tasks it can cause
    queue job fail as the stages not found for tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently importing tasks directly can import it's projects first but the
    performance of it is unstable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently the redirect uri which is set in connector clickup module must also be
    saved in Clickup Website's Clickup API app.
  </li>
